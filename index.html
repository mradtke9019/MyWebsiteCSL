                        In this project, I implemented a Multi level Feedback Queue CPU Scheduler for the XV6 operating system. Four levels created with Level 3 being the highest and Level 0 being the lowest. Each incoming process was promoted to level 3 and was given different amounts of execution time before being demoted to a lower level. Level 0 performed FIFO while level 1,2,3 performed Round Robin on each execution tick.

                        Created a basic shell in C that can execute other programs. I have implemented some of the basic features of a shell including history, cd, redirection, and setting the PATH variable to find binary executables. Execution of executables involves forking a child and replacing the child's code segment with the new exe's code segment. Parent shell then waits for child to finish execution.
